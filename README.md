ROCK PAPER SCISSORS !!! ðŸ‘Š âœ‹ âœŒ

Rock paper scissors is a hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand.

These shapes are "rock", "paper", and "scissors".

The rules are straightforward:

* Rock smashes scissors.
* Paper covers rock.
* Scissors cut paper.
